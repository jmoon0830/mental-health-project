The surveys are mapped where red represents large amount of surveys and grey is none. The map is filtered by year to see the difference in survey locations.
Although California had the largest surveys in both years, the survey locations elsewhere seem to change.

Three questions that revolved around how comfortable employees felt:
- *Coworkers* - Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your coworkers?
- *Supervisors* - Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with your direct supervisor(s)?
- *Anonymity* - Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources?

Although the ratio between yes and no from the supervisors and anonymity questions remain unchanged, there is a significant increase in "Yes" for the coworker's question.
We can assume that from employees felt more safer or comfortable about talking about mental health in the workplace within the two year period.

Lastly, we wanted to compare the gender demographics in surveys where employees answered "Yes" in regards to having a family history of mental issues.
According to the analysis, there are more males who have a family history of mental health illnesses compared to women.
