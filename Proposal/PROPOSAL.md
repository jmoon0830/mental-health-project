# Mental Health in the Workplace

## Summary

Analyze how mental illness is handled in the workplace. A dataset was found that surveys employees on how employers handle mental health. Visualizations will be created to help the end user understand the data. Harvard Study on Mental Health in the workplace talks about how important mental health is and what to look out for. https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/mental-health-problems-in-the-workplace

## Motivation
We want to analyze the data to make inferences on what the employer can do to improve mental health. What kind of support is offered in the workplace? Do employees feel safe to talk about it? What kind of support is offered? (i.e. Remote work - Leave - Does gender play role - Does age play a role) Do these vary depending state?
